# LLM_Telebot_GPT_3.5
A telegram bot using the LLM (Large Language Model) OpenAI API involves integrating Telegram's messaging platform
with OpenAI's language models to create an intelligent conversational agent. This project aims to develop a bot 
that can interact with users on Telegram, process their input using OpenAI's language model, and provide meaningful 
and contextually relevant responses.
